# Phishing_Detection_Project
# 🛡️ AI-Based Phishing Detection System

**Developed by:** Akankshi Dubey

This project detects phishing emails using **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression) and **TF-IDF features**.  
It provides a **real-time web interface** using **Streamlit** to classify emails as **Phishing** or **Safe**.

---

## 🔹 Features

- Detect phishing emails in real-time  
- Streamlit-based interactive web interface  
- High accuracy: **98%+**  
- Simple and easy-to-use  
- Suitable for **cybersecurity applications**

---

## 🔹 How It Works

1. **Dataset preprocessing:** Email text is cleaned and processed.  
2. **Feature extraction:** Text is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF.  
3. **Model training:** Logistic Regression classifier is trained on the dataset.  
4. **Prediction:** User can input any email and the model predicts phishing or safe.  
5. **Web interface:** Streamlit provides a simple interface to test emails.
